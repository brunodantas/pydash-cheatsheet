# about

This page is meant to be a starting point and quick reference for [pydash](https://pydash.readthedocs.io/en/latest/index.html), containing some of its most widely useful functions that aren't easily covered by modern Python. I also used this page as a project to get more familiarized with pydash and generating documentation programatically with [Material for MkDocs](https://squidfunk.github.io/mkdocs-material/). Any suggestions are welcome at [the repo](https://github.com/brunodantas/pydash-cheatsheet/issues).
